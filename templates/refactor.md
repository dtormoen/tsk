{{DESCRIPTION}}

## Refactoring Best Practices
While working on the change, keep in mind the following:
- Leave the code better than when you got it.
- Ruthlessly simplify. Maintain the core user experience, but don't shy from changes that simplify or improve.
- Add documentation for functions, classes, and modules following rustdoc best practices where it is missing.
- Look for and fix code smells.

## Final Steps
After you implement the change, please do the following steps:
- Add or update tests to make sure everything is working as expected
- Run `just precommit` to make sure files are formatted correctly and tests pass
- Make sure documentation is up to date. Keep it simple, but ensure documentation is accurate with the current state of the code
- Commit your changes following the Conventional Commits specification with a descriptive summary of the changes
