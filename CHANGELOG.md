## [Unreleased]

- display model name in claude code log processor output
- add support for custom squid proxy configuration

### Fixed

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2025-09-08

This release should make Docker builds more reliable overall, but it does introduce a
breaking change where docker layer snippets for projects, agents, and stacks which
previously would be stored in e.g. `.tsk/dockerfiles/project/<project_name>/Dockerfile`
are now stored in `.tsk/dockerfiles/project/<project_name>.dockerfile`. See the `.tsk`
or `dockerfiles` directory in `tsk` for examples of how to structure Dockerfile snippets.

### Added

- add Docker build lock manager to prevent concurrent image builds
- implement agent version tracking for automatic Docker rebuilds
- increase CPU and memory limits to 8 CPUs and 12gb
- [**breaking**] simplify Docker image generation with Handlebars templating

### Fixed

- copy working directory versions of files including unstaged changes
- improve lua stack snippet
- allow dots and underscores in project names for Docker layer matching

### Other

- upgrade go version in docker snippet
- extract proxy management into dedicated ProxyManager module
- simplify Docker asset directory structure
- *(server)* replace TaskExecutor with TaskScheduler and WorkerPool

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2025-09-01

### Fixed

- handle non-JSON output gracefully in Claude Code log processor
- rework Python tech-stack to use UV with proper virtual environment
- add support for symlinks in git repository copy operations

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0) - 2025-08-25

This release is largely focused on refactoring which will help create a solid foundation
for future planned changes. Some notable improvements are:
- Fix that ensures proxy can be restarted (requires a `tsk docker build`)
- Fixed `tsk debug` so now you can start an interactive session with Claude in a docker 
  container or debug issues with the project docker containers you've created
- tsk checks if claude code is working before launching a container. If this step fails, 
  it typically means you've used up your subscription limits. `tsk` will now retry the 
  task once each hour rather than fail it outright. This can be used for example to 
  queue up a lot of work overnight and tsk will wait until your limit is refilled
- Unit tests are faster, no longer flaky, and are easier to properly isolate to run
  in parallel

### Added

- [**breaking**] fix debug command and add interactive agent support
- [**breaking**] add is_interactive field to Task for controlling execution mode
- add automatic retry for agent warmup failures in server mode

### Fixed
