## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.8.6...v0.9.0) - 2026-02-23

This is a large release that replaces filesystem-based Docker layer customization with
inline TOML configuration and restructures the config file format. See the migration
guide below if you have an existing `tsk.toml` or custom Dockerfiles.

**Migrating from 0.8.x:**

- **Config format**: The old `[docker]`, `[proxy]`, and `[git_town]` sections are replaced
  by `[defaults]` and `[project.<name>]`. TSK detects the old format and prints a migration
  error with guidance. Move your settings into the new shape — see the
  [Configuration File](README.md#configuration-file) section in the README for examples.
- **Custom Dockerfiles**: Filesystem-based Docker layers (e.g., `.tsk/dockerfiles/project/`,
  `~/.config/tsk/dockerfiles/`) are no longer used. Replace them with `setup`,
  `stack_config.<name>.setup`, or `agent_config.<name>.setup` fields in your `tsk.toml`.
  Run `tsk docker build --dry-run` to preview the generated Dockerfile.
- **Project-level config**: You can now check in shared project defaults at `.tsk/tsk.toml`
  (same shape as `[defaults]`).
- **Claude Code users**: Install the `tsk-config` skill to have Claude walk you through
  the migration interactively: `/plugin marketplace add dtormoen/tsk` then
  `/plugin install tsk-config@dtormoen/tsk`.

### Added

- [**breaking**] restructure config with `[defaults]` / `[project.<name>]` sections and project-level `.tsk/tsk.toml`
- replace filesystem-based Docker layers with inline `setup`, `stack_config`, and `agent_config` fields in tsk.toml
- auto-migrate deprecated tsk.toml config format with actionable error messages

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.7.1...v0.8.0) - 2026-02-09

There are a lot of under the hood improvements, but the headlines here are:
- Added a `--parent` flag for tasks which allows task chaining. Very powerful
  when combined with a Claude Code skill that teaches Claude how to use TSK.
- Added automatic tsk-proxy container management so it'll shut down when not in use.
- `tsk server start` will now kill running containers when you use ctrl-c to exit.
- Migrated json task storage to sql and renamed task directories to be just their task ID.
- Added the ability to add a description to your task templates via yaml frontmatter.
  Run `tsk template list` to see task descriptions.
- Improved TUI output tables in `tsk list` and `tsk template list` commands.

Task chaining allows you to specify parent child relationships between tasks. TSK will
wait to schedule a child task until the parent completes and the child will start from
the branch that the parent created.

There are two breaking changes:
- The `tsk proxy` commands are removed in favor of automatic proxy container management.
- Migrating to SQL storage and simplifying task directory paths. These changes did not
  cause issues in my testing, however, this is a large change and there may be cases
  that are broken with tasks created before the migration.

### Added

- implement graceful server shutdown with container cleanup
- skip cleaning parent tasks with active children
- track shell and run tasks in the database
- replace IPC-based server stop with SIGTERM via PID file
- remove IPC from add and list commands in favor of direct SQLite access
- simplify storage wrapper from Arc<Mutex<Box<dyn TaskStorage>>> to Arc<dyn TaskStorage>
- add busy_timeout PRAGMA to SQLite storage for safe concurrent access
- run network isolation tests conditionally in precommit
- add TSK_CONTAINER and TSK_TASK_ID env vars to task containers
- add color coding to status column in tsk list
- support multiple parent IDs in database schema
- remove JsonTaskStorage and clean up legacy JSON references
- add automatic migration from tasks.json to SQLite
- wire SqliteTaskStorage as default storage backend
- add rusqlite dependency and implement SqliteTaskStorage
- add bold+underline styling to table headers
- add frontmatter support to task templates
- add duration column to list and replace table borders with aligned columns

### Other

- improve network isolation diagram

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.6.5...v0.7.0) - 2026-02-03

This version fixes mutltiple ways agents could bypass the proxy and as a result, could
potentially break workflows that relied on that ability. Agents containers now have their
own separate networks without any external access other the proxy and the proxy has a
more restrictive firewall configuration.

To help ensure that there is a way for common workflows to work, this release adds the
ability to forward specific ports to localhost so you can run local services like development
databases or service endpoints and expose those specific endpoints. This release also adds an
way to pass environment varibles to agents via the tsk.toml config file without needing to
create/edit dockerfiles.

Here is an example tsk.toml which configures `my-project` to pass env variables for Postgres
and Redis which are running on localhost:

```toml
[proxy]
host_services = [5432, 6379]  # e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis

[project.my-project]
env = [
    # Environment variables passed to the container
    { name = "DATABASE_URL", value = "postgres://tsk-proxy:5432/mydb" },
    { name = "REDIS_URL", value = "redis://tsk-proxy:6379" },
]
```

### Added

- add per-project environment variable configuration
- harden proxy container with iptables firewall and security options
- add host service TCP port forwarding via socat
- [**breaking**] implement per-container network isolation for agents

### Fixed

- correct proxy container permissions for tmpfs and squid operation

### Other

- add network isolation guide with architecture diagrams
- add network isolation test script for container security

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.5.4...v0.6.0) - 2025-10-26

This release has a few large changes. First we've added
[codex](https://openai.com/codex/) support! You can now launch codex agents or even
launch multiple agents in parallel:

```bash
tsk add --type feat --name greeting --description "Add a greeting to all TSK commands" --agent claude,codex
```

This will create two tasks that are identical except for `claude` will work on one and
`codex` will work on the other. This is great for comparing the performance of different
agents.

We've also simplified TSK commands:
- `tsk debug` is now called `tsk shell`
- `tsk quick` is now called `tsk run`
- `tsk run` has been removed
- `--timeout` has been removed from a few commands as it was not actually implemented
- The `claude-code` agent has been renamed to `claude` throughout the codebase

### Added

- [**breaking**] simplify command structure for better UX
- add multi-agent support for task creation
- *(codex)* improve log processor output quality
- *(codex)* add JSON log processor with human-readable output
- add codex agent support

### Other

- reorganize and enhance README
- improve documentation
- rename claude-code agent to claude

    - The model being used e.g. opus or sonnet
    - The sub-agent that is active
    - The full instructions and outputs of sub-agents

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2025-09-08

This release should make Docker builds more reliable overall, but it does introduce a
breaking change where docker layer snippets for projects, agents, and stacks which
previously would be stored in e.g. `.tsk/dockerfiles/project/<project_name>/Dockerfile`
are now stored in `.tsk/dockerfiles/project/<project_name>.dockerfile`. See the `.tsk`
or `dockerfiles` directory in `tsk` for examples of how to structure Dockerfile snippets.

### Added

- add Docker build lock manager to prevent concurrent image builds
- implement agent version tracking for automatic Docker rebuilds

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0) - 2025-08-25

This release is largely focused on refactoring which will help create a solid foundation
for future planned changes. Some notable improvements are:
- Fix that ensures proxy can be restarted (requires a `tsk docker build`)
- Fixed `tsk debug` so now you can start an interactive session with Claude in a docker 
  container or debug issues with the project docker containers you've created
- tsk checks if claude code is working before launching a container. If this step fails, 
  it typically means you've used up your subscription limits. `tsk` will now retry the 
  task once each hour rather than fail it outright. This can be used for example to 
  queue up a lot of work overnight and tsk will wait until your limit is refilled
- Unit tests are faster, no longer flaky, and are easier to properly isolate to run
  in parallel
